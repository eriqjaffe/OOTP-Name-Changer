# OOTP Name Changer

An Electron-based dekstop app allowing users to convert legacy name sets for [Out of the Park Baseball](https://www.ootpdevelopments.com/out-of-the-park-baseball-home) into the XML file the game uses now, as well as the ability to merge multiple XML files into one.  If you don't have OOTP, then this will be of little use to you.

# Installation notes

To run this from source, you will need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), and then...

```
git clone https://github.com/eriqjaffe/OOTP-Name-Changer && cd OOTP-Name-Changer
yarn
yarn start
```
Or you can grab a pre-compiled binary from the "releases" section.  Binaries are available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

Because I'm not a registered developer with Apple, macOS may block the app for security reasons (not a bad thing for it to do, ultimately).  If this happens, just CTRL-click on the app and choose "Open" from the menu - that will bring up a slightly different version of the security message with an option to open the app.  You *should* only have to do that once and macOS should store an exception for the app going forward.

Similarly, Windows might pop up a "Windows protected your PC" message when you try to run the installer.  If that happens, just click "More info" and "Run anyway".
